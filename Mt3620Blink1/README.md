description: "Demonstrates how to use a button to change the blink rate of an LED, which is accessed via GPIO (general-purpose input/output)."

# Sample: GPIO high-level app

This application does the following:

- Provides access to one of the LEDs on the MT3620 development board using GPIO
- Uses a button to change the blink rate of the LED

The sample uses the following Azure Sphere libraries.

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [GPIO](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-gpio/gpio-overview) | Manages button A and LED 1 on the device |
| [log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-log/log-overview) | Displays messages in the Device Output window during debugging |
| [EventLoop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-eventloop/eventloop-overview) | Invoke handlers for timer events |

## Prerequisites

The sample requires the following hardware:

Avnet Azure Sphere Starter Kit (Rev1 or Rev2)

## Prepare the sample

1. Ensure that your Azure Sphere device is connected to your computer, and your computer is connected to the internet.
1. Even if you've performed this setup previously, ensure that you have Azure Sphere SDK version 21.01 or above. At the command prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Upgrade the Azure Sphere SDK for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk) or [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk-linux) as needed.
1. Enable application development, if you have not already done so, by entering the following line at the command prompt:

   `azsphere device enable-development`

1. Clone the [Azure Sphere samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples) repo and find the GPIO_HighLevelApp sample in the GPIO folder.

## Build and run the sample

The application can be modified to blink either the red, green, or blue RGB LED element.  Mofify line #82 in main.c to select which LED to blink.


    // Define what color LED to blink, valid choices are . . .
    // AVNET_MT3620_SK_USER_LED_RED
    // AVNET_MT3620_SK_USER_LED_GREEN
    // AVNET_MT3620_SK_USER_LED_BLUE
    GPIO_Id ledGPIO = AVNET_MT3620_SK_USER_LED_GREEN;

To build and run this sample, follow the instructions in [Build a sample application](../../../BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Observe the output

 LED1 on the MT3620 begins blinking green.

 Press button A repeatedly to cycle through the 3 possible blink rates.

You will need the component ID to stop or start the application. To get the component ID, enter the command `azsphere device app show-status`. Azure Sphere will return the component ID (a GUID) and the current state (running, stopped, or debugging) of the application.

```sh
C:\Build>azsphere device app show-status
12345678-9abc-def0-1234-a76c9a9e98f7: App state: running
```

To stop the application enter the command `azsphere device app stop -i <component ID>`.

To restart the application enter the command `azsphere device app start -i <component ID>`.
